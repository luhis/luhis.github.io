You need to use an app to write to them, and not all of them are iPhone compatible, but once the SIM is programmed you don't need to do it again.</p>\n<p>I have an old Xiaomi 11t, it has dual SIM.  One is my home card, the other is a <a href=\"https://a.aliexpress.com/_EyEM2Y4\">Switch SIM</a> I paid 17GBP for, other cards are available, but this was the cheapest at the time I was looking.</p>\n<h2>Roamless</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.roamless.com/OOq0/pdeh8pwp\">Roamless</a> offer an eSim service, there are others similarly priced, but this is the one I settled on using.  It costs around $2/gb for the places I find myself.  I havr used it in Japan, USA, China, Hong Kong, and Indonesia without issue.</p>\n<h2>Ad Blocking</h2>\n<p>The eSim data is cheap, but it's not as cheap as my standard Sim, so it's worth reminding that you can block out the ads with <a href=\"https://nextdns.io/\">nextDNS</a> to save on some data, maybe use <a href=\"https://newpipe.net/\">newpipe</a> too for YouTube so you can download videos over Wi-Fi.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"14 hours ago","title":"eSIM for legacy mobile phones","author":"Matt McCorry","tags":"eSIM,Travel"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1a73baa9-b825-5e4c-84a5-49f98b1fcd60","fields__slug":"esim","__params":{"fields__slug":"esim"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2525421997"],"slicesMap":{}}
