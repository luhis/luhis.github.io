Over the past few years I have tried to learn quantum computing, and failed. But I get closer each time. Here are some of the best materials I have found so far.

## Q#

[Q#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/qsharp-overview) is the official Microsoft quantum language. THey provide an emulator to run on your local machine, and it is supported in Azure for running production code. It's great, you install it, open a template and it just runs.

## Quantum Soar

[Quantum Soar](https://www.youtube.com/@quantum-soar) is a Quantum computing education channel, they have paid courses, but the free YouTube content is a great introduction.

## Learn Quantum Computing with Python and Q#

I bought this [book](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-quantum-computing-with-python-and-q-sharp) during covid planning to become an expert on quantum programming. It never worked out, but it has sat on a shelf for years reminding me that this is still something I want to learn.

## In the news

I wonder sometimes if quantum will ever go anywhere. There are sometimes stories about quantum supremacy, but nothing in industry. Recently [this article](https://www.zerohedge.com/ai/hsbc-achieves-quantum-computing-sputnik-moment-bond-market) came up, so it looks as if there are industry uses for quantum.
