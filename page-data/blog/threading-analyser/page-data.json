Just like how ReSharper suggests you convert your loop into a Linq statement, but as of Roslyn the hooks are built into the compiler, as opposed to old ReSharper that used to do its own compilation in parallel.</p>\n<h2>Microsoft.VisualStudio.Threading.Analyzers</h2>\n<p>Microsoft have their own threading analyser that they use internally. It provides a lot of useful hints when writing async code, just install the Nuget package, and it will start flagging up issues.</p>\n<p>Word of warning, it is not a private package, so if you install it into project, all the other projects referencing that project will start getting useful async hints. This can become a headache if you build a Nuget with this package as a dependency, ask me how I know.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Threading.Analyzers/\">Nuget</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"3 years ago","title":"Microsoft's Threading Analyser","author":"Matt McCorry","tags":"C#,DotNet,Analysers"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/threading-analyser/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3460496508"]}
