I noticed that the amount of principal paid per month dropped, allowing for the smaller monthly payment increase.</p>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p>Assume a nominal £100,000 mortgage over 25 years.  One will be fixed at 2% for the term, one will be fixed at 2% for 5 years, 4% for 5 years, and 2% again for the final 15 years.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Payment Year 1-5</th>\n<th>Payment Year 6-10</th>\n<th>Payment Year 11-25</th>\n<th>Total</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Fixed 25 Year</td>\n<td>£424</td>\n<td>£424</td>\n<td>£424</td>\n<td>£127,156</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 year increase</td>\n<td>£424</td>\n<td>£508</td>\n<td>£442</td>\n<td>£135,480.00</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Why?</h2>\n<p>At the end of the mortgage, the majority of the payment goes to principal, very little to interest, so there is more cash available at the end of the mortgage to pay down the principal, so in turn earlier in the mortgage, less needs to be paid down.  This explains why the amount of principal paid per month dropped when the rate when up. It must also work the opposite way too, where a time of lower interest rate would decrease the monthly payment due even when the rate goes back up.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"6 days ago","title":"Interest Rate Impact Upon Principal","author":"Matt McCorry","tags":"Mortgage,Interest"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/interest-rate-impact-on-principal/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3460496508"]}
