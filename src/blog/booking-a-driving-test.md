You've probably heard it's really difficult to book a driving test, the rumours are correct.  But, here is how I booked my wife's driving test.

## Test Date Releases

New test dates drop on a Monday morning, the booking site is available from 6am. Obviously, everyone and his dog wants to get a test at 6am, so there's a queue.  Log in at about 5:50am, queue for 10/15mins and you should get in.

The first time I got in, I was a little late, about 6:15.  I spent ages going backwards and forwards looking for available dates at the favoured test location, but I have now learnt that if you get the 'Requested date is unavailable' error message, it actually means there is nothing available at that centre.  When I logged in earlier the next week, I picked a date in mid-December and was given mid-January dates to pick from.

## Shunt Your Date with Testy

Once you have a date booked, use (testi)[https://testi-app.co.uk] to move it to an earlier cancelled slot.
