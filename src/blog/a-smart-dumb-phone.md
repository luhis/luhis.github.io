During covid, I spent time looking into dumb phones, as I wanted to avoid all the tracking nonsense. Qin was a brand that stuck out. They had Android feature phones, but they were a bit too limited in power.

A few years later, and with the government pushing for digital ID, there is a lot of interest in dumb phones again.

## Qin F22 Pro

Qin is a sub brand of Xiaomi. They do budget feature phones of varying specifications. When I bought mine, the F22 Pro was the [top spec](https://www.gsmchoice.com/en/catalogue/duoqin/f22pro) candy bar phone offered.

## Installing a clean ROM

Make sure to make backups of your phone, as you may end up in trouble without it, follow [this guide](https://binboupan.github.io/2023/12/qin-f22-pro-gsi) to make your backup and put it somewhere safe.  Don't worry about the ROM listed there, it's not the most up to date.

[Download the ROM here](https://xdaforums.com/t/flash-xiaomi-qin-f22-pro-stock-firmware-with-google-play-with-and-without-root.4509111) and follow the guide to install it on your phone. When you think you phone it working, check you haven't [lost your IMEI number](https://snwritetool.com).

## Summary

I had a great time playing with my F22 Pro.  I broke it many times, but it's working just fine now.

It brought back old memories of my first Android, the ZTE Blade. I bought it, unlocked it in the first 10 minutes, flashed a custom ROM that night. The old android days were fun before we needed a phone to do everything, we could play and erase our phones.
